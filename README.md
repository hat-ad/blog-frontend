`All the Optional and Required tasks are implemented such as Google Social auth login, Socket connection to notify on blog update, editing and deletinf feature, and form handling using yup`

Due to some firewall realted issues wasn't able to complete the deployement on vercel, but it works perfectly fine in local setup.

Open [https://blog-frontend-seven-bice.vercel.app/](https://blog-frontend-seven-bice.vercel.app/) with your browser to see the frontend deployment however due to firewall related issue cannot connect to backend.
